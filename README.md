# RP2040 + LED Driver + Accelerometer

I had an idea and a couple of hours. So I designed this over the weekend.

Need to refind the schematic, then work on layout and write code to everything working.

V0: RP2040 + TLC59711 + LIS2DH + 24 LEDs



All the design files will stay public and opensource.
