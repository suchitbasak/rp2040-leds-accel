# RP2040 + LED Driver + Accelerometer

I had an idea and a couple of hours. So I designed this over the weekend.

Need to refind the schematic, then work on layout and write code to everything working.

V0: RP2040 + TLC59116 + LIS2DH + 32 LEDs

I have already used the TLC59711 in a design before. Wanted to try out a new driver.

All the design files will stay public and opensource.
